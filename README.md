# Compilers Project
A programming project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of Compilers. This project features three languages: C, Java and Python and the Flex lexical analyzer. We include: a Python solution for the balanced parentheses problem using a pushdown automaton, a Python program that generates random character sequences based on specific grammar, a Java program that implements a top-down syntax analyzer and two lexical analyzers in Flex for sample variable and geometric shape declaration.
